This is an Android project using MVVM architecture with Jetpack Compose.

GENERAL RULES
- Follow MVVM strictly.
- Do NOT put business logic in Activities or Composables.
- All business logic must live in ViewModel or Domain layer.
- Prefer immutability and unidirectional data flow.

ARCHITECTURE
- UI layer: Jetpack Compose only.
- State is exposed from ViewModel via StateFlow.
- UI observes state and renders only.
- Events from UI are sent to ViewModel via functions or UiEvent.

NAMING CONVENTIONS
- ViewModel classes must end with ViewModel.
- UI state classes must end with UiState.
- UI events must be sealed classes named UiEvent.
- Repositories must end with Repository.

COMPOSE GUIDELINES
- Prefer stateless composables.
- Hoist state to ViewModel.
- Avoid remember {} for business state.
- Use Scaffold for screen-level composables.
- Side effects must use LaunchedEffect or SideEffect properly.

PACKAGE STRUCTURE
- Organize code by feature, not by layer.
- Each feature should contain:
  - ui/
  - viewmodel/
  - repository/

CODE STYLE
- Prefer Kotlin Coroutines + Flow.
- Avoid LiveData unless necessary.
- Avoid mutable public state.
- Use data classes for UI state.

DO NOT SUGGEST
- XML layouts
- MVP or MVC patterns
- Business logic inside Composables
- Direct repository calls from UI

This project ignores generated and IDE files such as build outputs and .idea files.
